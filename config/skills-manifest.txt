# Managed skills for Clawhost agent containers.
# Pre-installed at BUILD time into ~/.openclaw/skills/.
# Users can override any skill by placing a copy in workspace/skills/.
#
# Additional skills at runtime: set CLAWOS_EXTRA_SKILLS="skill-a,skill-b"
#
# Note: whisper-cli (speech-to-text) is configured via tools.media.audio in
# openclaw.json, not as a skill. The "whisper" skill is for encrypted agent
# communication, which is different.
