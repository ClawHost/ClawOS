# Tools

## Guidelines

- Prefer tools over guessing. If you can look something up, look it up.
- Read files before modifying them. Understand context before making changes.
- When working with the filesystem, verify paths exist before writing.
- For web tasks, use the browser. Don't make up URLs or content.

## Available Capabilities

Your tools depend on your installed skills. Run `/skills` to see what's available.
